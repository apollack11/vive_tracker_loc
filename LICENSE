NOTICE: Portions of this project are tightly based off of OSVR-Vive-Libre
 which is under a forced-source license.  I have rewritten as much as I can
 to avoid that, however, I may have made some mistakes.  Magic numbers
 have not been modified as they cannot and (thankfully) are exempt from 
 copyright law.
